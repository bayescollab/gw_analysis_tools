/*! \mainpage Gravitational Waves Analysis Tools

A suite of analysis tools useful for gravitational wave science. All code is written in C++, with some of the interface classes wrapped in Cython to allow for python-access.

\section Required Software

Required non-standard C libraries:
FFTW3
ADOL-C
GSL

Required non-standard Python packages:
Cython 

Required non-standard packages for documentation:
Doxygen

\section Installation
For proper compilation, update or create the enviornment variables CDIR and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which should point to header files and lib files, respectively. Specifically, these variables should point to the above libraries. 

\section Supported Functionality 

\subsection Waveform Generation
IMRPhenomD, IMRPhenomPv2

\subsection Modified Gravity
ppE_IMRPhenomD_Inspiral ppE_IMRPhenomD_IMR ppE_IMRPhenomP_Inspiral ppE_IMRPhenomP_IMR 

\subsection Fisher Analysis
utilizes the above waveform templates

\subsection MCMC Routines
Includes log likelihood caclulation

\section Usage
\subsection Enviornment variables
The python path PYTHONPATH should include the directory \$(PROJECT_DIR)/gw_analysis_tools_py/

\subsection Include
To include header files, use -I\$(PROJECT_DIRECTORY)/include

\subsection Link
To link object files, use -L\$(PROJECT_DIRECTORY)/lib -lgwanalysistools
