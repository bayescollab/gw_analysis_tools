Contributions to this source code would be very much appreciated (both corrections or additions)!
We use branches and pull requests to facilitate this kind of work, so please follow the follow steps for contributing to this project:

0. Optional - For corrections, file a bug report first so people know someone's working on it and are aware of the issue

1. Pull the latest code from the repository (probably from the master branch):
```bash
git pull
```

2. Create a new branch and make it available on the online repository with the following command (where \<feature-branch\> can be anything you'd like to call it)
```bash
git checkout -b <feature-branch>
git push origin <feature-branch>
```

3. Next, make your corrections to the code

4. Stage the changes 
```bash
git add <modified/added files>
git commit -m "A very clear and helpful message"
```

5. Push the changes to the online repository
```bash
git push origin <feature-branch>
```

6. Make a pull request through the online GUI. This will start a discuss and verification process before the code is eventually merged by a moderator.
